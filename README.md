Kirino-Engine combines an ECS-based data-oriented architecture,
explicit modern OpenGL abstractions,
and a hybrid CPU-GPU rendering pipeline 
to reimagine Minecraft's traditional, tightly coupled, and CPU-bound rendering.

Its primary goal is to overhaul most of Minecraft’s rendering in a future-proof and elegant manner, 
provide a set of clean rendering APIs to mod developers, 
**_and_** serve as a platform for exploring the feasibility of modern, GPU-driven rendering techniques within Minecraft’s constraints.

Looking further ahead, the long-term goal is to evolve into a general-purpose engine kernel for Minecraft,
while keeping the main focus on rendering. To illustrate, we will pay more attention to lifecycles, phases, and systems, 
rather than features, compatibility with legacy solutions, or similar concerns.

> The project is highly WIP - contributions are welcome to help accelerate development!<br>
> Currently working on the terrain rendering pipeline.

## Non-Goals
- Not a drop-in performance patch
- Not a strict compatibility target
- Not an object-centric rendering engine
- Not a finalized or frozen architecture
- Not a high-fidelity path tracing solution

## What This Project Provides?

### 1) Engine-agnostic ECS framework

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

- Data-oriented SoA archetypes as the data model, 
  designed for predictable memory layout
- Strict separation of entity identity, component storage, and system execution
- Designed to integrate with other data-oriented tech stacks like
  job systems, execution graphs

</details>

### 2) Low-level OpenGL abstraction layer

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

The project provides a low-level, semantic abstraction layer over modern OpenGL.
Rather than acting as a black-box wrapper, this layer aims to preserve the
meaning of OpenGL operations, **_and_** explain the implicit and subtle assumptions clearly. (WIP; partially usable)

You may find those abstractions handy if you know/use GL already.

The goal of this layer is not to hide OpenGL, but to **clarify** it.

</details>

### 3) Rendering engine implementation

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

Building on the ECS framework and OpenGL abstraction, the project includes a
concrete rendering engine implementation. (WIP)

The engine is designed around a hybrid CPU-GPU pipeline, where high-level
orchestration remains on the CPU while some jobs like culling, data processing are delegated to the GPU.

> **Note**: Minecraft is mostly used as a data source and constraint, rather
> than as a strict compatibility target.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute, please take a look at our
[Contributing Page](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Kirino-Engine?tab=contributing-ov-file)
and the [Engine Overview](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Kirino-Engine/blob/main/ENGINE_OVERVIEW.md)
to understand the project’s assumptions and architectural direction.

To keep discussions productive, please read the guidelines below.

### Clarification
Before proposing changes or opening discussions, please:

- Treat/Assume the current design choices as intentional and valid start points
  (that is, reason within the given assumption space; feel free to do contradictions)
- Base your reasoning on the assumptions implied by the existing docs
- Focus on internal consistency, trade-offs, and constructive outcomes

### What a Good Proposal Looks Like

**Good example**:
1. Assume the staging buffer and resource management designs are valid and
   their stated (or implied) design principles are satisfied
2. Demonstrate how the staging buffer design creates tension within the resource management principles
3. Conclude that the staging buffer design may need some fix

This kind of proposal helps identify real issues while respecting the project’s intent.

### What to Avoid

**Less helpful examples:**

- “Why ECS? Why GPU-driven? Why XXX?”
- “ECS isn’t useful; OOP might be faster based on my past tuning experience”

These questions re-open foundational decisions **_without engaging with the project’s assumption space_**.

If you believe core assumptions lead to issues,
please demonstrate how it contradicts itself in this specific context.

### Main idea & Notes

We expect contributors to make sufficient assumptions and show valid reasonings.

If the goal is to accelerate development, arguments should avoid:
- Implicit equivalences
- Unstated assumptions
- Invalid inference steps

_Clear reasoning is more valuable than confident conclusions._

**_But_**, _please don’t feel discouraged if your reasoning isn’t formal.
This project values thoughtful discussion. If an idea is
proposed in good faith, incomplete and informal reasoning is still welcome._

**Small reasoning notes**:
- Showing that a design choice `A` is flawed does not imply that an alternative `B`
  is therefore correct
- Showing that a design choice `A` implies an alternative `B` does not guarantee
  that rejecting `A` disqualifies `B`.

## FAQs

<details>
<summary>Click to Expand</summary>

- Why is Kirino-Engine different compared to OptiFine / Sodium / Iris?
  - Because Kirino-Engine reimagines the entire rendering pipeline without patching things in an unmaintainable way
  - Kirino-Engine is fundamentally GPU-driven and ECS-driven, unlike traditional optimizers or shader mods
  - Kirino-Engine pays a huge attention to its architecture
  - Kirino-Engine isn't merely an optimizer or shader mod — it's a research-oriented rendering engine
  - See [Assumption Space](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Kirino-Engine/blob/main/docs/assumptions.md) for detailed reasonings too

<br>

- Will Kirino-Engine be compatible with OptiFine / Sodium / Iris?
  - No, because Kirino-Engine replaces the whole rendering pipeline
  - _**But**_, Kirino-Engine isn't tightly coupled with rendering. 
    You can try disabling the rendering part of the engine, and things might work

<br>

- What's the most exciting features in dev?
  - GPU-Driven Meshlet Rendering
  - Modern Rendering Paradigms (like Multi-Draw Indirect, Pipeline State Objects, etc.)
  - Semi-Static Global Illumination Driven by Surface Cards & Temporal Accumulation
  - ECS, Parallel Job, and Execution Graph (a Multithread-Friendly Architecture)
  - Async GPU Resource System
  - Multi-resolution & HDR & Post-processing Pipeline

<br>

- What can I _expect_ as a player?
  - Performance wise: smoother performance and FPS improvements; Higher CPU & GPU utilization
  - Shader wise: modern lighting techniques and better global illumination
  - Configurability: optional HDR, optional resolution up-scaling or down-scaling, optional post-processing, etc.
  - Ecosystem: easily extensible rendering pipeline for community mods and shaders

<br>

- What can I _expect_ as a mod developer?
  - Clean rendering APIs that hide OpenGL completely
  - Versatile rendering APIs that focus on the concept of render commands
  - Constrained and explicit engine lifecycle
  - ECS runtime
  - Will be able to create emissive blocks, PBR, fogs, decals, any post-processing effects
  - Future-proof architecture
